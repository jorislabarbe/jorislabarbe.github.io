My areas of expertise are the modelling, the computation and the analysis (both theoretically and numerically) of a broad range of systems in fluid mechanics. Most of my research interests have applications in geophysics, astrophysics, coastal engineering and related domains.

I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Northumbria University under the supervision of Oleg N. Kirillov before starting a one-year postdoctoral program at IRPHE (Marseille, France) with P. Le Gal, B. Favier and S. Le Dizès to investigate the stability of stratified shear flows.

Currently, I am involved in a postdoctoral research project at LJAD (Nice, France) in collaboration with Prof. D. Clamond to work on water waves (and related topics).

My list of publications, the projects I am involved with and my resume are available from the menu in the top-right corner.
