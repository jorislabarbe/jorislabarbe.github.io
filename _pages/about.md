My areas of expertise are the modelling, the computation and the analysis (both theoretical and numerical) of a broad range of hydrodynamical systems. Most of my research interests have applications in the fields of geophysics, astrophysics, coastal engineering and related domains.

I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Northumbria University (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK) under the supervision of Oleg N. Kirillov. I then started a one-year postdoctoral programme at IRPHE (Marseille, France) with P. Le Gal, B. Favier and S. Le Dizès to study the stability of stratified shear flows. I follows up with a postdoctoral research project at LJAD (Nice, France) collaborating with D. Clamond to work on water waves recovery.

Since October 2024 I have a permanent position at Laboratoire J. A. Dieudonné as a CNRS researcher (Chargé de Recherche).

A list of my publications and my CV are available from the menu on the top right.
